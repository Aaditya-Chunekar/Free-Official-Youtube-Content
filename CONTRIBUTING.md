**Follow the Markdown format**

**If it's in any way linked to something that you normally have to pay to see, and the channel is active and posts related content to it, then add it and write a short description of the type of content**

This list will only focus on official YouTube channels who have the rights to post the content online, no unofficial uploaders are allowed

Don't add YouTubers to the list, unless they focus on restoring and/or uploading public domain content like old movies and documentaries

Don't add region locked channels that require [a VPN](https://fmhy.net/privacy#vpn) to look at their content, I've had many suggested channels with lots of playlists which were hidden because they were region locked to a certain area. These are outside the scope of my list, mainly because if you need [a VPN](https://fmhy.net/privacy#vpn) just to access them [you might as well just pirate the thing entirely](https://fmhy.net/beginners-guide) or [watch it legally](https://fmhy.net/video#free-w-ads)
